## Hi there 👋

I'm a computational chemist based in London-UK with more than **6 years of experience** in industry and academia combined.

My focus area for the past few years has been small molecule de-novo drug design using generative AI, QSAR modeling, physics-based virtual screening and general purpose cheminformatics.

I work closely with fellow medicinal and computational chemists, software and ML engineers on hit-to-lead and lead optimisation projects involving targets such as kinases, GPCRs, viral proteases and polymerases, etc.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small-molecule drug discovery projects by applying physics and AI based methods.
- 🌱 I'm always in a perpetual learning mode in various aspects of medchem, cheminformatics, machine-learning, etc
- ⏳ History geek.
