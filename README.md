## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computational chemist based in London-UK with **6 years of experience** in academia and industry.

My focus area for the past few years has been small molecule de-novo drug design using generative AI, QSAR modeling, physics-based virtual screening and general purpose cheminformatics.

I work closely with fellow medicinal and computational chemists, software and ML engineers on hit-to-lead and lead optimisation projects involving targets such as kinases, GPCRs, viral proteases and polymerases, etc.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on computational drug discovery projects by applying physics and AI based methods.
- ðŸŒ± I'm always in a perpetual learning mode, whether it be various aspects of lead-opt, cheminformatics, machine-learning, etc

- âš¡ Fun fact: A group of flamingos is called a â€˜flamboyanceâ€™â€”which is also what happens when computational chemists try to design molecules late on a Friday!
