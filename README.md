## Ganesh Shahane, PhD

**`Sr. Scientist, Computational Chemistry`**

I'm a computational chemist based in London-UK with more than **6 years of experience** in industry and academia combined.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on small-molecule drug discovery projects by applying computational physics and AI based methods.
- 🌱 I'm always in a perpetual learning mode in various aspects of medchem, cheminformatics, machine-learning, etc
- 🧑🏻‍💻 Software I use: Schrödinger Maestro, VS Code (Jupyter Notebooks), Pymol and ChemDraw.
- ⏳ Current hobbies include hiking, board games, and being a history geek 📖.
